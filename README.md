# A-comparison-of-Long-Short-Term-Memory-LSTM-and-Convolutional-Neural-Network-CNN-LSTM-models-for-Air-Particulate-Matter-Prediction
The objective of this project was to develop a neural network model that combines Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architectures to predict the amount of PM_2.5 concentrations in the air. The eventual, tuned model was applied to hourly air quality data from 12 air quality monitoring sites in Beijing, China, and predicted PM_2.5 concentrations with about 96% accuracy.

In this report a neural network model based on CNN-LSTM was compared to an LSTM model to predict the amount of  PM2.5 in the atmosphere.  The dataset of contained air pollution measurements from the city of  Wanshouxigong in Beijing, China, which was sampled every hour. The time series dataset was split into training, validation, and test sets. The training data was used for training the model while the validation data was held back during training of the model and used to evaluate the performance during training. The test set was unused during training but used to evaluate the mode performance after training and to compute the RMSE.
The problem was formatted to a supervised learning problem to predict future values of PM2.5. The results show that a hybrid CNN-LSTM model outperforms an LSTM model in predicting future air pollution. This provides valuable information for application of CNN-LSTM models in resolving other time series problems.
